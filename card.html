				<em>
					Contrary to popular belief, polar bears actually have black skin
					(which can be seen on their snouts and in the surrounding area).
					The purpose of their highly pigmented skin is to better absorb and
					retain the sun's warmthâ€”a handy trait in the harsh Arctic tundra.

				<p>
					When you think of a polar bear, you think of thick, white fur.
					These bears are massive, with the largest ever recorded standing
					just over 11 ft. tall on its hind legs!
				</p>
				<p>
					Their feet are incredibly large as well, measuring 12 in. across on adults.
					This size helps them distribute their weight on thin ice, and swim
					efficiently in water. In comparison to other bears, their body is more
					 elongated, and they have a longer head and muzzle.
